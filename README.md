## Overview

The Jee Recommendation Model is a machine learning-based system for predicting future seat allocation rankings using deep neural networks. It is tailored to assist students in understanding trends and making informed decisions about their academic choices.

---

## Parameters

The model takes the following input parameters:

- **Institute Name with Specialized Course**: Specify the institute and course details.
- **Quota**: Applicable quota, e.g., AI (All India).
- **Gender**: Choose between 'Gender Neutral' for males or 'Female'.
- **Year**: The academic year for analysis.
- **Academic Program**: The program you wish to pursue.
- **Seat Type**: Category of seat allocation.
- **PWD Type**: Whether the applicant has a disability (Yes/No).

## Performance

- **Model Architecture**: The ANN consists of 4 layers, including an input layer, two hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons respectively, and an output layer. ReLU activation is used for hidden layers, and a softmax function is applied in the output layer.
- **Dataset**: The model was trained on a dataset containing historical seat allocation data from 2016 to 2024, consisting of 20,000 records.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved 77% accuracy on the test dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE):  0.2730918526649475
  - R2_Score : 0.7746634929494804
- **Hardware Used**: Trained on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU for optimal performance.

## FAQ

**Q:** What if my institute or program is not listed?\
**A:** Please raise an issue on GitHub, and weâ€™ll update the dataset.

**Q:** Can I use this system for non-IIT institutions?\
**A:** Currently, the model is optimized for IITs only.
